# Docker Compose override for shared/remote server mode.
#
# Use with:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.core.yml up -d
#
# This disables services that developers typically run locally (PGR, UI,
# Jupyter) so there are no conflicts when multiple devs connect to the
# same remote server.
#
# Kong stays running on the remote as the shared API gateway.

services:
  pgr-services:
    profiles: [local-dev]   # won't start unless explicitly requested

  digit-ui:
    profiles: [local-dev]

  jupyter:
