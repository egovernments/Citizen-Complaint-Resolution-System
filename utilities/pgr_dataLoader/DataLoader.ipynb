    "- Basic localization keys\n",
    "- Admin boundary structure\n",

    "- Make sure the Excel file is in the `templates/` folder\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📋 Overview\n",
    "In Phase 3, you will configure all common master data and PGR complaint configurations for your tenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Do:\n",
    "1. **Enter Target Tenant ID** (e.g., `pg.citya` for city-level tenant)\n",
    "2. **Upload Common Master Excel** with departments, designations, and complaint types\n",
    "3. **System automatically creates:**\n",
    "   - Department records in MDMS\n",
    "   - Designation records in MDMS\n",
    "   - Complaint types and sub-types\n",
    "   - SLA configurations\n",
    "   - Localization entries for all master data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📄 Template Required:\n",
    "- **Common and Complaint Master.xlsx**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Sheets in Template:\n",
    "1. **Department Master** - List all departments (e.g., Public Works, Sanitation)\n",
    "2. **Designation Master** - List all designations (e.g., Engineer, Supervisor)\n",
    "3. **Complaint Type Master** - Main complaint categories\n",
    "4. **Complaint SubType Master** - Sub-categories under each type\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ What Gets Created:\n",
    "- Departments with auto-generated codes (e.g., `DEPT_1`, `DEPT_2`)\n",
    "- Designations with auto-generated codes (e.g., `DESIG_01`, `DESIG_02`)\n",
    "- Complaint types with IDs and SLA hours\n",
    "- Complaint sub-types linked to parent types\n",
    "- Localization messages for all entries (en_IN, hi_IN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important:\n",
    "- Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 before Phase 3\n",
    "- Use city-level tenant ID (e.g., `pg.citya`, not just `pg`)\n",
    "- Departments and Designations created here will be used in Phase 4 (Employee Creation)\n"

    "## 📋 Overview:\n",
    "1. **Generate Dynamic Template** - Creates Excel with dropdowns pre-filled from MDMS\n",
    "2. **Fill Employee Data** - Use the template to add employee details\n",
    "3. **Upload Excel** - Upload the filled template\n",
    "4. **Auto Role Validation** - System checks & creates missing roles in MDMS\n",
    "5. **Bulk Create** - Creates all employees via HRMS API\n",
    "6. **Status Tracking** - Excel updated with color-coded status (🟢 SUCCESS, 🟡 EXISTS, 🔴 FAILED)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Features:\n",
    "- ✅ **Name-based Excel** - Use department/designation/role NAMES, system converts to codes\n",
    "- ✅ **Date pickers** - Excel date inputs instead of timestamps\n",
    "- ✅ **README - Roles sheet** - Copy-paste ready role names\n",
    "- ✅ **Auto role creation** - Missing roles automatically created in MDMS\n",
    "- ✅ **Error handling** - Status appended to each row with details\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Template Sheets:\n",
    "1. **Instructions** - Complete usage guide\n",
    "2. **README - Roles** - All available roles to copy from\n",
    "3. **Employee Master** - Main data entry sheet\n",
