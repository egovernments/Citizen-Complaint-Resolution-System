    "- **Tenant And Branding Master.xlsx**\n",

    "## ✅ What Gets Created:\n",

    "- City-level tenant records (e.g., `pg.citya`)\n",
    "- Branding configuration (logo, theme, colors)\n",
    "- Basic localization keys\n",
    "- Admin boundary structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important:\n",
    "- Make sure the Excel file is in the `templates/` folder\n",
    "- Tenant ID must be lowercase (e.g., `pg`, not `PG`)\n",

    "3. **Complaint Type Master** - Main complaint categories\n",
    "4. **Complaint SubType Master** - Sub-categories under each type\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ What Gets Created:\n",
    "- Departments with auto-generated codes (e.g., `DEPT_1`, `DEPT_2`)\n",
    "- Designations with auto-generated codes (e.g., `DESIG_01`, `DESIG_02`)\n",
    "- Complaint types with IDs and SLA hours\n",
    "- Complaint sub-types linked to parent types\n",
    "- Localization messages for all entries (en_IN, hi_IN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important:\n",
