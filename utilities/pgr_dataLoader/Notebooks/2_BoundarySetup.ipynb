    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook handles **Phase 2: Boundary Management** - creating the geographic and administrative hierarchy for your tenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Boundaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundaries represent the administrative divisions of your city/state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "City (Level 1)\n",
    "  ├── Zone (Level 2)\n",
    "      ├── Ward (Level 3)\n",
    "          ├── Block (Level 4)\n",
    "              └── Locality (Level 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can define your own hierarchy levels based on your needs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **Completed Notebook 1** - Tenant must exist in system\n",
    "- [ ] **Know your tenant code** (e.g., `pg.citya`, `statea`)\n",
    "- [ ] **Boundary data ready** - Have your administrative divisions mapped\n",
    "- [ ] **Authentication token** - Will need to re-authenticate\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Authenticate\n",
    "Login to DIGIT Gateway (same as Notebook 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Select/Create Hierarchy\n",
    "- **Option A:** Use existing hierarchy (if already defined)\n",
    "- **Option B:** Create new hierarchy definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Generate Template\n",
    "System creates dynamic Excel template based on your hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Fill Boundary Data\n",
    "Download and fill the generated Excel template\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Upload & Process\n",
    "Upload filled template - system validates and creates boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Verify\n",
    "Check boundary creation status and results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Boundary Template Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated template will have columns like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column | Description | Mandatory | Example |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| Country | Country name | Yes | India |\n",
    "| State | State name | Yes | Punjab |\n",

    "| Zone | Zone name | No | Zone 1 |\n",
    "| Ward | Ward name/number | No | Ward 12 |\n",
    "| Block | Sub-ward division | No | Block A |\n",
    "| Code | Unique boundary code | Yes | PG_CITYA_ZONE1 |\n",
    "| Parent Code | Parent boundary code | Required (except Level 1) | PG_CITYA |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Columns vary based on your hierarchy definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy Rules:\n",
    "1. **Level 1 (City)** has NO parent\n",
    "2. **All other levels** MUST have a valid parent code\n",
    "3. **Parent must exist** before creating child\n",
    "4. **Codes must be unique** across the tenant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Valid Structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Code              | Name    | Parent Code\n",
    "------------------|---------|-------------\n",
    "PG_CITYA          | City A  | (empty)\n",
    "PG_CITYA_Z1       | Zone 1  | PG_CITYA\n",
    "PG_CITYA_Z1_W1    | Ward 1  | PG_CITYA_Z1\n",
    "PG_CITYA_Z1_W1_B1 | Block 1 | PG_CITYA_Z1_W1\n",
